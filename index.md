## Schedule
The course is divided into five modules. The end of each module acts as the due date for materials tied to the module and coincides with either an in-class exam or project presentation. The topic discussed in the final module ("Topics in Perception") will be determined by a ranked choice vote in class on Wednesday, August 30.

Required readings refer to chapters in the 10th edition of Sensation and Perception by Goldstein & Brockmole unless otherwise specificed here. While you can cover the readings at any time during the module, we will discuss topics from each reading roughly in the order that they are presented (approximately one reading per week). For other readings, follow the links below to find them!

## Course Policies

### Assignments and Exams
All assignments and exams are to be submitted in person, on paper, prior to the beginning of the exam or presentation at the end of the module. Items submitted late, but within one week of the due date will receive half credit. No assignments are accepted after that time. Assignments to submit include exam preps and book club leader reports -- and the book club plan, project plan, and final project presentation notes in the relevant modules. 

Exams will consist of a mixture of multiple choice and short answer questions; you will never need to write more than a short paragraph for any one answer. Exams will cover material from lectures and activities in the preceding module as well as from assigned readings. The final exam will be cumulative, and include material from the entire course (including the special topics). The lowest scoring exam for each student will be dropped from the final grade calculation (including missed exams). Make-up exams can only be taken with a letter from the Dean of Students recommending for an accomodation.

### Grades
You will have a short period in class or in office hours to check your exam grades. You are responsible for tracking your own grades across the course of the class. Please come to office hours if you would like help calculating possible final grades!
