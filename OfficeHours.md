## Office Hours

Office hours are a time set aside where you can come and talk to the instructor -- there are many reasons to do this in general (for both this class and other classes);
*  Ask questions about topics that you're having a hard time understanding.
*  Ask questions about topics that you have a good understanding of, but want to explore more.
*  Review exams and talk about grades.
*  Talk about academic career options.
*  Get to know instructors -- which can be helpful for finding people to do research with or to TA for! Also, the first step in having someone who can write a good letter of recommendation for you.
